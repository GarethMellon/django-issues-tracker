Issue Tracker Project

The purpose of this doc is to give a high level overview of that the ticket tracker will look like and outline a minimum viable product.
This doc will lead into the creation of User Stories and tickets which will be added to https://trello.com/b/aKFZcGf5/issuetracker

***ENTITIES***

We have two types of users.  A DEV and a USER.  A DEv user requires a log in, and normal using does not.

- DEV user
-- Can view the public facing ticket dashboard.
-- Can log into as a Developer.
-- Can accept or reject a ticket for work.
-- Can create and edit tickets.
-- Can add comments to tickets.

-- Can add user comments to a ticket.
-- Can upvote a ticket.
-- Can submit a payment for some ticket actions

Before a ticket is viewable on the dashboard.  A DEV user must accept or reject a ticket.  New tickets that are submitted by a user are displayed where.  



*** DASHBOARD ***

The DASHBOARD is the main landing page for the application.  We will show a list of tickets, top 10, most upvoted, etc.
When you are logged in we treate the user as a DEV.  Otherwise we see the user as a USER

points to show on the DASHBOARD
- Show top 10 open features ordered by most voted, then priority, created date
- Show top 10 open features ordered by most voted, then priority, created date
- date filter by date 
- Search by ticket id.
- add graphs where possible.

- can open a ticket, view updates and edit tickets (as a DEV)



*** PAID FEATURES ***
BUG type tickets have no payments features.

FEATURES type tickets have payments added in.
- As a user adding a new feature will require a payment.
- As a user upvoting a new feature will require a payment.
- If you are logged in as a DEV you bypass payments.
